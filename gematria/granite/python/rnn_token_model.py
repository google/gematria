  """A token-based model using the Granite graph construction and an RNN layer.

  The model uses a graph network to compute embedding vectors for instructions
  and an RNN layer to process these vectors using short- and long-term
  relations between instructions. The graph network is the same as in the
  TokenGraphBuilderModel class in
  gematria/granite/python/token_graph_builder_model.py.

  The model is composed of the following parts:
    1. Token-based embedding vectors. Each token recognized by
       feature_tokens.TokenFeatureFactory is assigned a learnable embedding
       vector of a given size.
    2. A Graph neural network using a sequence of dense layers as update
       functions.
    3. An RNN network that consumes the feature vectors of instruction nodes
       from the graph neural net. The instruction nodes are presented to the
       RNN network in the order in which the instructions appear in the basic
       block.
    4. An optional shared dense readout network that processes the outputs of
       the RNN layer. When this network is not used, the data is passed
       unchanged to the next step.
    5. An optional task-specific dense readout network that processes the
       outputs of the shared readout network. When this network is not used, the
       data is passed unchanged to the next step.
    6. A task-specific linear layer that computes the output of the network.

  The behavior of the dense readout networks is different for seq2seq and
  seq2num models:
    * For seq2num models, we use the output of the last RNN cell as an input
      for the dense readout network, i.e. the readout is computed once per basic
      block.
    * For seq2seq models, we apply the readout network on the output of each
      RNN cell, and the readout network predicts the delta (the throughput
      increment) for the instruction corresponding to that RNN cell. The
      prediction for the basic block is then computed as the sum of the
      per-instruction predictions.
