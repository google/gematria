// Contains code that efficiently converts basic blocks from the format used by
// Gematria to a graph format suitable for processing with TensorFlow and the
// graph_nets library [1]. See the paper [2] for more details on the graph data
// structure used by the graph_nets library. The code in this module is intended
// to be used primarily from Python via a pybind11 wrapper.
//
// Each basic block is transformed into a single graph that covers the data flow
// in the basic block as well as the layout structure of the basic block. The
// node and global feature vectors created by the graph builder are based on the
// tokens from the canonicalized representation of the instructions in the basic
// blocks processed by the graph builder. The vocabulary of all tokens must be
// provided during the construction of the graph builder. The feature "vector"
// of each node is a single integer scalar, which is the index of the
// token associated with the node in the token vocabulary. See below for more
// information on the relation between the nodes of the graph and the tokens.
//
// The basic blocks are transformed into a graph as follows:
//  - The basic block is represented as a collection of nodes that represent the
//    instructions in the basic block and their operands. The edges represent
//    the relationships between the instructions and the operands.
//  - There are three basic types of nodes with several sub-types: instruction
//    nodes that represent instructions in the basic block, value nodes that
//    represent the data consumed and produced in the basic block, and address
//    computation nodes that represent the address computation within another
//    instruction.
//  - Each instruction is represented as a single (instruction) node of type
//    NodeType::kInstruction. The feature of the node is the index of the
//    mnemonic of the instruction in the vocabulary of tokens. In the following
//    text, we unify the instruction and the node that represents the
//    instruction.
//    All instruction nodes in the graph are connected using edges of type
//    EdgeType::kStructuralDependency into a path that represents the order of
//    of the instructions in the basic block.
//  - The value nodes represent the operands of the instruction. They are value
//    oriented, i.e. when two different values are written to the same storage
//    location, each is represented by a different node in the graph. A value
//    nodes has zero or one incoming edge of type EdgeType::kOutputOperands from
//    the instruction that produces the value, and zero or more outgoing edges
//    of type EdgeType::kInputOperands to instructions and address computation
//    nodes that consume the value.
//
//    There are the following types of value nodes:
//    - Register nodes (NodeType::kRegister) represent values stored in
//      registers of the CPU. The feature of the node is the index of the name
//      of the register in the token vocabulary.
//    - Immediate value and floating-point immediate value nodes
//      (NodeType::kImmediate and NodeType::kFpImmediate) represent immediate
//      values in the code. Each immediate value in the code is represented by
//      its own node. These nodes never have incoming edges. All immediate value
//      nodes use the same value provided during the initialization of the graph
//      builder as their feature. Same for the floating-point immediate value
//      nodes.
//    - Memory nodes (NodeType::kMemoryOperand) represent values stored in the
//      memory of the computer. All memory operands use the same feature value,
//      provided during the initialization of the basic block graph builder.
//  - The address computation represent the x86-64 address computation using the
//    ModR/M and SIB bytes. They are represented by a single node of type
//    NodeType::kAddressOperand that is connected to the instruction using the
//    address (using an EdgeType::kInputOperands edge). The components of the
//    address computation are nodes representing the registers and the immediate
//    values used in the address computation, connected to the address
//    computation node using edges of types EdgeType::kAddressBaseRegister,
//    EdgeType::kAddressIndexRegister, and EdgeType::kAddressDisplacement; each
//    of these edge types can be used at most once; the base and index register
//    edges can be used only with register nodes, and the displacement edge can
//    be used only with an immediate value node.
