class TrainingEpochStats:
  """Contains statistics from a single step of model training.

  These statistics are meant for printing to log during training and for a human
  reader, a full set of statistics for later analysis is also emitted using the
  TensorFlow summaries APIs.

  The covered statistics include: the selected loss, mean squared errors, mean
  absolute errors, mean absolute percentage errors, and percentiles of absolute
  errors and absolute percentage errors. Statistics that are difficult to
  interpret and not commonly used are not included.

  For models trained using deltas (per-instruction/prefix based expected
  outputs), we collect the stats both for the final output, and for the deltas.
  Note that we do not collect relative errors for deltas: the expected values
  are often very small and relative errors on deltas are thus often ill-defined.

  The loss is stored as a single floating point value; all other values are
  stored per-task, and they are stored as NumPy arrays.

  Attributes:
    epoch: The global step (epoch) at which the stats were collected.
    loss: The loss value used for training the model. In multi-task models, this
      is the combined loss for all tasks.
    percentile_ranks: The list of ranks of the collected percentiles.
    absolute_mse: The absolute mean square error at the step. Has shape
      [num_tasks] where num_tasks is the number of tasks of the model.
    relative_mae: The relative mean absolute error at the step. Has shape
      [num_tasks].
    relative_mse: The relative mean square error at the step. Has shape
      [num_tasks].
    absolute_delta_mse: The absolute mean square error on deltas at the step.
      Only used by seq2seq models. Has shape [num_tasks].
    absolute_delta_mae: The absolute mean error on deltas at the step. Only used
      by seq2seq models. Has shape [num_tasks].
    absolute_error_percentiles: The percentiles of the absolute error. Has shape
      [len(this.percentile_ranks), num_tasks].
    relative_error_percentiles: The percentiles of the relative error. Has shape
      [len(this.percentile_ranks), num_tasks].
    absolute_delta_error_percentiles: The percentiles of the absolute error on
      deltas. Only used by seq2seq models. Has shape
      [len(this.percentile_ranks), num_tasks].
